The dataset consists of various data types, including float, int, boolean, and str, distributed across different columns. All types of data will be treated to check the best columns will do a feature select, pre_process, and train the model. As mentioned earlier, our primary goal is to predict the locations with the highest incident occurrence. By mapping these areas across Chicago, we aim to assist police authorities in effectively allocating resources and intensifying police vigilance.
